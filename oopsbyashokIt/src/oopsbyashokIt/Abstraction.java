	/**
	 * Two way to create a class object - by using new operator and by using class also you can create the object.
	 * The Process of hiding un-necessary data and providing only required data
	    We can achieve Abstraction using interfaces and abstract class 
	--  We will combine variables and methods as a single unit class.
	--  It is used for data hiding
	--  Abstract class can have Constructor

	
		Example-
	 --We will not bother about how laptop working internally
	--- We will not bother about how car engine starting internally
	
	 Abstract class contains 2 methods...
	 =======++Types of Methods=========
	 1. Concrete Method ---> The Method which contains body.
	 *  Every java program has written by Using Concrete Methods.
	 *  eg-  void m1(){
	 *  			//Logic
	 *  		}
	 2. Abstract Method---> The Methods doesn't contain the body.
	 		syntax- 
	 		public abstract void m2();
	 * */
	
	/*  
	*  Abstraction - Abstraction doesn't contains methods body 
	*  static - It is the first priority to run code in JVM
	*  void - If method don't want to return anything
	*  return - If we want to return anything
	*  break- If we come out from the loop 
	*  continue - If we skip current iteration 
	*  if - If we check the condition 
	*  else - if condition is not satisfied then go else statement
	*  switch - If we can check 5 and more condition then we will go for switch statement.
	*  case - Inside the switch case is available
	*  for - It is execute a loop based on the range(For is a range based loop)
	*  while - It is execute a loop based on condition
	*  do - First execute the statement then go for condition
	*  byte 
	*  short// There are 8 primitive data type available in Java
	*  int
	*  Long
	*  float
	*  double
	*  boolean
	*  char
	*
